Cleaned-up version of my dotfiles. Clone, copy everything matching `.[a-z]*` to your home directory,
and copy `~/.bashrc.d/settings.default` to `~/.bashrc.d/settings` and edit to suit.

What's included:-
* auto-loading of `pyenv`, `rbenv` and `asdf` if found
  - https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
  - https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv
  - https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf
* vim plugins as submodules
  - indentLine
  - jedi-vim
  - python-mode
  - vim-airline
  - vim-json
  - vim-sensible
* tmux configuration and aliases
* helper functions for starting an `ssh-agent`, and toggling it on and off
* handy shortcuts for openssl commands (see `bashrc.d/sections/openssl.bashrc`)

...plus other bits.

There's a lot that needs tidying up here, but you're welcome to steal bits of this as you like.
